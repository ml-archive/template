A Vapor template for convenient and fast scaffolding 🏎


## 📦 Installation

### Creating a project

You can create a new project using the [Vapor toolbox](https://vapor.github.io/documentation/getting-started/install-toolbox.html).
```bash
vapor new MyApp --template=nodes-vapor/template
```

## Getting started 🚀

### Project name

Before building your project you need to change the name of the project in `Package.swift`. Look for `name: "NodesTemplate"` and adjust it to fit your project.

### Environment variables

Before running your project, you need to make sure you have the following environment variables set up. For more information on how do this, have a look at our guide [here](https://github.com/nodes-vapor/readme/blob/master/Documentation/how-to-setup-environment-variables.md). All the different keys for environment variables are defined in `Utilities/EnvironmentKey.swift`.

Alternatively use the included `.env.example` file. Copy the file to `.env`, enable your required environment variables and add their values.

#### Project

These are project-specific values such as the name of the project (e.g. "My Blog") and the url of the current environment (e.g. http://my-blog.com).

#### MySQL

For MySQL you can either use a connection string (using the `DATABASE_URL` key) or you can supply hostname, username, password and database individually. These will be set automatically on Vapor Cloud, but they will need to be set when running locally.

#### Redis

Similar to MySQL, you can either use a connection string (using the `REDIS_URL` key) or you can supply hostname and database individually. These will be set automatically on Vapor Cloud, but they will need to be set when running locally.

#### Mailgun

In order to send out emails using Mailgun, the Mailgun environment variables need to be set.

#### JWT Keychain

For generating tokens, a couple of signers need to be set for JWT Keychain. These can be generated by using `openssl rand -base64 32`. Remember to generate different values for each environment.

#### Admin Panel

Similar to JWT Keychain, Admin Panel also needs a signer to be set.

#### Reset

For handling reset of passwords, Reset also needs a couple of signers to be set (similar to JWT Keychain).

#### Nodes SSO

To enable Nodes SSO on Admin Panel the project needs to be [created on Ournodes](https://github.com/nodes-projects/readme/blob/master/server-side/nodes-sso.md) (private link) and the environment variables needs to be set up in the project. Be aware when using SSO locally to specify the PROJECT_URL environment variable with `http`

#### Bugsnag

To support error reporting to Bugsnag, a project needs to be created on our organization and the API key needs to be added to the project.

### Storage

Remember to update `configure.swift` and set the correct `pathTemplate` for the `S3Driver`. If you're deploying to Vapor Cloud, then `nodestemplate` should be replaced by your app name on Vapor Cloud. If you're deploying to somewhere else than Vapor Cloud, you might want to change the template pattern.

## Project layout 🗂

This project template aims to follow the official [Vapor Style guidelines](https://docs.vapor.codes/3.0/extras/style-guide/), with some minor additions/deviations:

- We have introduced a `providers.swift` file to handle setting up of providers.
- We have introduced a `leafTags.swift` file to handle setting up of Leaf tags.
- We have a folder named `External` for any third party integrations (we used to name this folder Services in Vapor 2).


## Xcode project  🔨

[Vapor toolbox](https://vapor.github.io/documentation/getting-started/install-toolbox.html) makes it simple to generate a project for Xcode.
```bash
vapor xcode -y
```

### Starting your server  🏁
In Xcode, select the `Run` scheme if you want to startup your server.


### Testing your code ⏱
For testing, make sure to have the `MyProject-Package` scheme selected. Then, you can use `⌘U` like usual.
