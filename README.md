A Vapor template for convenient and fast scaffolding üèé


## üì¶ Installation

### Creating a project

You can create a new project using the [Vapor toolbox](https://vapor.github.io/documentation/getting-started/install-toolbox.html).
```bash
vapor new MyApp --template=nodes-vapor/template
```

## Getting started üöÄ

### Project name

Before building your project you need to change the name of the project in `Package.swift`. Look for `name: "NodesTemplate"` and adjust it to fit your project.

### Environment variables

Before running your project, you need to make sure you have the environment variables set up. Use the included `.env.example` file. Copy the file to `.env`, enable your required environment variables and add their values.

Make sure to use unique and strong secrets for the signer keys (ie. the keys ending in `_SIGNER_KEY`). The keys should be unique within and across environments and projects. To generate the keys you can issue the following terminal command: `openssl rand -hex 64`.

#### PostgreSQL

For PostgreSQL you can either use a connection string (using the `POSTGRESQL_URL` key) or you can supply hostname, username, password and database individually.

#### Redis

Similar to PostgreSQL, you can either use a connection string (using the `REDIS_URL` key) or you can supply hostname and database individually.

#### Mailgun

In order to send out emails using Mailgun, the Mailgun environment variables need to be set.

#### JWT Keychain

For generating tokens, a couple of signers need to be set for JWT Keychain. These can be generated by using `openssl rand -base64 32`. Remember to generate different values for each environment.

#### Reset

For handling reset of passwords, Reset also needs a couple of signers to be set (similar to JWT Keychain).

#### Nodes SSO

To enable Nodes SSO on Admin Panel the project needs to be [created on Ournodes](https://github.com/nodes-projects/readme/blob/master/server-side/nodes-sso.md) (private link) and the environment variables needs to be set up in the project. Be aware when using SSO locally to specify the PROJECT_URL environment variable with `http`

#### Bugsnag

To support error reporting to Bugsnag, a project needs to be created on our organization and the API key needs to be added to the project.
